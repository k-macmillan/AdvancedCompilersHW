\subsection{A compiler and an interpreter}
Compilers are different from interpreters or they would not be separate things. In general terms a compiler takes something and turns it into something else. An interpreter does the same thing but not as efficiently. The compiler we use to compile C++ will read through our code and reduce it to assembly instructions for the machine we are on. While doing this it will evaluate some parts of the code and place things in an ``optimal'' ordering. An interpreter does not look at the code until execution, meaning it has almost no room to perform optimizations. Another difference is that interpreters are able to take code on the fly, whereas a compiled language must have everything at compile time. 

\subsection{A statically typed language and a dynamically typed language}
Statically typed languages are strict on type, whereas dynamically typed languages determine which type to use. There are two primary benefits to statically typed languages:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item type-safe -- You must declare the type and it will be enforced
    \item speed -- Knowing the type ahead of time means it doesn't have to figure it out on the fly
\end{itemize}
